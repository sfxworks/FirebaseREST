# FirebaseREST

Largely based on phantom's guide seen at https://github.com/PhantomAppDevelopment and distriqt's Firebase API seen at https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Firebase (requires premission), this aims to create a working REST API for users wanting to connect from the browser.

Feel free to commit extras as I am only working on certain features.
